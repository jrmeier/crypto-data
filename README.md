# Crypto Data
This is for storing minute by minute trading data, in a way that's accurate but cheap.

# Goals
- No database (since it's read only, I don't think it really matters)
- Fast 
- Accurate

# Features
- raw data for a ticker for every minute
- build trading data files with the available indicators built-in (consumption comes from different projects)
